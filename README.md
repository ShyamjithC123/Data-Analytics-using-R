## Day-3

Day 3 is devoted to advanced data analytics in R programming. The main focus is on how to practically analyze likert-scaled data collected through online forms like `Goggle Form` or `Microsoft Form`. On successful completion of this session, the participant will be able to:
1. analyze the Likert-scaled data using R
2. create a report in many format using `yaml` options in R Studio
3. create an analysis web page in `Github`
4. create a publication-ready document using `rticle` package

### Part-1
>**Data analytics of Fruit preference Data**
Link to the `markdown` file:
<https://github.com/sijuswamy/Data-Analytics-using-R/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20fruit%20preference%20data.Rmd>

>**Task 1:** Complete the analysis by running the r codes chunk by chunk and prepare an `html` file by `knitting` the `.Rmd` file.
### Part-2

>**Report automation:**

>**Task 2:** Generate a complete report of the analysis in `.pdf` format.

### Part-3
>**Parameterized report generation**

- Clone  the repository <https://github.com/sijuswamy/CO-Target-Fixation-Template> into your workspace
- Run the `Target_Fixation_template.Rmd` for report generation

## Day 5 (Online mode)

### Documentation & Report Generation

Last day is devoted for capstone projects.

**CProject-1 Title:**  `A business model possibility analysis based on customer feedback`

**Requirements**

>The participants are advised to transform the `Fruit data analysis` in to a scientific journal paper with `elsevier` style. The article should have all the requirements as per the journal policies.

**CProject-2 Title:** `Automation of Course Attainment Target fixation of First Year accademics using R`

>*Requirements*

The participants are advised to transform the parameterized report generation task in to a process automation work, which will create Branch specific web pages with proper `tocs` and can be directly connected to a campus website.
